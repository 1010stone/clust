|                            RESULTS SUMMARY                             |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Clust analysed the profiles of 1811 object groups (OGs)* in 3          |
| datasets. It generated 5 clusters of OGs, which in total include 199   |
| OGs. The smallest cluster includes 14 OGs, the largest cluster         |
| includes 96 OGs, and the average cluster size is 39.8 OGs. 1612 OGs    |
| were not included in any cluster at all.                               |
|                                                                        |
| * An OG is a group of synonymous objects within & across different     |
| types, as identified by the provided map. For example, a group of      |
| orthologous genes within and across species represents an OG.          |
